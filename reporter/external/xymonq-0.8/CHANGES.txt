CHANGES.txt for xymonq

v0.8 (2018-01-26)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

FEATURES:

- new option `-p` to prefix each line of output with the hostname (for
  `clientlog`, `xymondlog` and `xymondboard` queries). The hostname is taken
  from `hosts.cfg` and printed in the form `hostname: `.

BUG FIXES:

- correct spelling-error in usage and man-page: The `config` querytype was
  mis-named `client`

IMPROVEMENTS:

- code-improvements: eliminate `eval` where possible; improved function naming


v0.7 (2017-12-13)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES:

- config-loading was broken for the pre v0.6 behaviour of auto-searching the
  config file.

- the list-filter for `clientlog` was to restrictive, resulting in too few
  sections to show up. It did not match `msgs:` and `logfile:` for instance.
  Now clientlog-sections are matched against `\[[^]]+\]` resulting in all
  sections to show up. (command: `xymonq -q clientlog -H myhost -l`)


v0.6 (2017-12-10)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

FEATURES:

- add possibility to specify config-file to to use with `-c conf-file`. The
  default remains the auto-search w/ fallback to internal defaults.

- allow more default-values to be set in config-file (TEST, FIELDS, SECTION)

- add `config` query to retrieve `.cfg`-files from the xymon-server. The file
  can be specified with `-f file.cfg`. If no file is specified it defaults to
  `hosts.cfg`.


v0.5 (2016-02-06)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

FEATURES:

- add `hostinfo` query to fetch the configuration from `hosts.cfg` for one or
  more hosts. While the host-selection is fully available there are currently
  on output options, thus just the output from `xymon "hostlist [CRITERIA]"` is
  printed as-is.

- `ghostlist` may now be abbreviated as `ghost`

BUG FIXES:

- the sorting of the test-list (`xymonq -q xymondlog -l -S`) was incorrectly
  sorting the `HOST=`-separator line. Removed the sorting completely for now.


v0.4 (2015-10-15)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

FEATURES:

- add `ghostlist` query to fetch the ghostlist. This also allows to
  select based on the age of the report.

- add `version` / `ping` query to get the version of the Xymon server
  `xymonq` is communicating with.

- read configuration from external config-file, see included sample
  `xymonq.cfg` and the man-page for details.


IMPROVEMENTS:

- only build hostlist if needed for further operations

- help and man page: more examples, better structure, added shore description
  for querytypes 


v0.3 (2015-10-06)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Except for the volume-mode corner case (see below) this version can replace
v0.2.

IMPROVEMENTS:

- introduce a `volume-mode`: used in `xymondboard`-mode without `-S`-option;
  this is not finished yet


BUG FIXES:

- hostname-search in `xymondboard`-mode: correctly anchor the regex to prevent
  returning data for too many hosts



v0.2 (2015-06-23)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
First public release


v0.1 (2015-05-12)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
not released to public
